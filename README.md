jQuery.safeAjax
===============

$.ajax wrapper that HTML escapes data before passing it to the success function.

Options and usage are identical to $.ajax (https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/).

**Note:** This extension does not prevent all forms of XSS, and is not a substitute for good coding practices.
